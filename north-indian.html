                  <p class="card-text">Chicken curry is a dish originating from the Indian subcontinent, common delicacy in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent, cuisine of Southeast Asia, as well as in the cuisine of the Caribbean (where it is usually referred to as curry chicken). 
                    A typical curry from the Indian subcontinent consists of chicken stewed in an onion- and tomato-based sauce, flavored with ginger, garlic, tomato puree, chili peppers and a variety of spices, often including turmeric, cumin, coriander, cinnamon, cardamom and so on. Outside South Asia, chicken curry is often made with a pre-made spice mixture known as curry powder.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Chhole bhature (Hindi: छोले भटूरे, Punjabi: ਛੋਲੇ ਭਟੂਰੇ) is a dish from the Punjab region in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. This Punjabi dish is a combination of chana masala (spicy white chickpeas) and bhatura, a fried bread made from maida flour (soft wheat).
                    Chhole bhature is often eaten as a breakfast dish, sometimes accompanied with lassi. However, it can also be a street food or a complete meal and may be accompanied by, for example, onions, carrot pickle, green chutney and achaar.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">Litti, along with chokha, is a complete meal originated from the Indian subcontinent; and popular in Indian states of Bihar, Jharkhand, parts of Eastern Uttar Pradesh as well as Nepalese state of Madhesh. 
                      It is a dough ball made up of whole wheat flour and stuffed with Sattu (roasted chickpea flour) mixed with herbs and spices and then roasted over coal or cow dung cakes or wood then it is tossed with lots of ghee. 
                      Although very often confused with the closely related Baati, it is a completely different dish in terms of taste, texture and preparation. It may be eaten with yogurt, baigan bharta, alu bharta, and papad.
                      The litti are traditionally baked over a cow-dung fire, but in the modern day a new fried version has been developed.
                      Herbs and spices used to flavour the litti include Onion, garlic, ginger, coriander leaves, lime juice, carom seeds, nigella seeds and salt. 
                      Tasty pickles can also be used to add spice flavour. In western Bihar and eastern Uttar Pradesh litti is served with murgh korma (a creamy chicken curry) or chokha (a vegetable preparation of roasted and mashed eggplant, tomato, and potato).
